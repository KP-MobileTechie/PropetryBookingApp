# React Native Expo Project

This is a React Native Expo project where you can run the app on Android and set up a local server to serve a `db.json` file.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js
- NPM
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies. We are using `npm -f` to force installation due to deprecated dependencies in the npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install -f
   ```

3. **Run the JSON Server**:
   The project requires a local server to serve a `db.json` file. To start the server, run:

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
   ```

   This will start a local server on port 3000, and you can use it for API calls in your project.

4. **Replace the IP Address in the Code**:
   In your project code, you need to replace the IP address `172.16.17.52` with your current local network IP address (your internet or Wi-Fi IP address).

   You can find your local IP address by searching for it using the following command:

   ```bash
   ifconfig  # macOS/Linux
   ipconfig  # Windows
   ```

   Alternatively, use the shortcut `Command + Shift + F` to search for `172.16.17.52` in your project and replace it with your actual IP address.

5. **Run the Project on Android**:
   To run the project on an Android device or emulator, execute:

   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

   This command will build and launch the app on your Android device.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your device or emulator is connected to the same network as your computer.
- If you face any issues, try clearing the cache or rebuilding the project using:

  ```bash
  npm start -- --reset-cache
  ```
